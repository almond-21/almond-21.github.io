            Homeostasis is the ability of living
            organisms to maintain a stable
            internal environment in response
            to external stimuli. It is an essential
            characteristic of life that enables
            survival in changing environments.
            In modern society, however, rapid
            changes in weather and climate have
            increasingly confined our living
            spaces to indoor environments. On
            days of heavy rain, extreme heat, or
            severe cold, people avoid outdoor
            activities, creating a physical distance
            from nature. At the same time, there
            has been a growing effort to recreate
            “nature” within indoor spaces.
            This reflects humanity’s attempts
            to artificially recreate an “idealized
            nature” while remaining disconnected
            from the real natural world.
            Now is the time to overcome
            our disconnection from nature
            and seek sustainable ways of
            interacting with the environment.
            Homeostasis Shelter offers a solution
            by subtly adjusting unpredictable
            external stimuli rather than
            simply imitating nature, providing
            humans with a comfortable state.
            It moderates extreme heat and cold,
            reducing the stimuli experienced
            by individuals, and is designed
            to harmonize with the natural
            environment while maintaining some
            level of dependence on it.
            Seoul is a city characterized by four
            distinct seasons and diverse climatic
            phenomena. Among its many
            landmarks, Yongbi Bridge, which
            spans Jungnangcheon Stream, serves
            as a pedestrian bridge connecting
            residential areas with a large park.
            It is a beloved outdoor space for city
            residents. In this location, defined by
            the linear flow of walking, cycling,
            and the river itself, the goal is to
            create a stationary shelter—a space
            where people can pause and rest,
            breaking away from the continuous
            motion.
